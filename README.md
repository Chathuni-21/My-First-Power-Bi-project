# My-First-Power-Bi-project
##Super Market Grocery Sales
We consider in detail supermarket grocery sales for an all-rounded view of business performance in our Power BI project. We go down to a granular level of the sales data, showing metrics by daily and monthly trends, product categories, and store locations. The kind of visualization that is supposed to underline bestsellers, shining a light on trends in customer purchase behavior to reveal some actionable points for strategic decision-making. Also, we monitor campaigns for their effectiveness and trace the increase in revenues over some time to give insight into the market dynamics to help in sustaining operations at optimization levels for its profitability.

## Project Overview
The Super Market Grocery Sales is an end-to-end exercise in business intelligence using Microsoft Power BI. It contains four major segments, methodically divided as under.


###1.Data Collection
Gather data from the supermarket regarding the sales of goods with details such as the name of the product, category, price, sub category, date, and customer information. 

###2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
 Clean the collected data for any errors, duplicates, or missing values. Make sure the consistency and format of the data are appropriate for analysis.

###3.Data Modeling
 Use cleaned data to create a structured model in Power BI.
 
###4. Measures and Calculations
These range from custom calculations, such as total sales, average sales per customer, and profit margins, to even growth rates, all using a Power BI-specific expression language called DAX. These measures will then be used in your visualizations.

###5.Building Visualizations
 Design interactive charts, graphs and dashboards in Power BI to bring out the key insights. 
 
###6. Dashboard and Report Development.
 Combine all the visualizations into one dashboard or report.
