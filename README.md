This Power BI project looks in-depth at supermarket grocery sales to present an all-rounded overview of business performance. It displays a detailed dashboard showing information on sales data, day and month breakdowns for metrics, product categories, and store locations. It highlights top-selling products and analyzes the customers' purchasing patterns to understand what works and what doesn't in customers' needs, striving to find meaningful insights that can help in strategic decision-making. We measure the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, track increases in revenues, and enable a proper understanding of market dynamics to help optimize for sustained profitability over time.

## Overview
This project involves analyzing supermarket grocery sales using Microsoft Power BI to gain insights into various aspects of business performance. The steps include data collection, cleaning, modeling, and the creation of interactive visualizations, leading to the development of a comprehensive dashboard.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection
Gather data from the supermarket regarding the sales of goods with details such as the name of the product, category, price, sub-category, date, and customer information.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Clean the collected data for any errors, duplicates, or missing values. Ensure the consistency and format of the data are appropriate for analysis.

### 3. Data Modeling
Use the cleaned data to create a structured model in Power BI.

### 4. Measures and Calculations
Perform custom calculations, such as total sales, average sales per customer, and profit margins, using Power BI's DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). These measures are then used in visualizations.

### 5. Building Visualizations
Design interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards in Power BI to highlight key insights.

### 6. Dashboard and Report Development
Combine all the visualizations into a single, comprehensive dashboard or report.
